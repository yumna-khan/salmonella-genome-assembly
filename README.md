## Introduction
A genome is a full set of genetic information encoded in an organism’s DNA. Typically, eukaryotes have a genome of more than 1 billion base pairs, whereas prokaryotic genomes are considerably smaller, usually consisting of only a few million base pairs (Wick et al., 2023). Genome assembly is the computational process of reconstructing a complete genome from shorter DNA sequences generated by sequencing technologies (Koren et al., 2013). Since many sequencing platforms cannot read an entire chromosome in a single pass, the DNA must be fragmented prior to sequencing, producing shorter sequences known as reads. The reads are sequenced multiple times to cover the length of the full genome (Wick et al., 2023). 

However, repetitive sequences introduce challenges for genome assembly and can lead to error prone or fragmented assemblies. When repeats exceed the length of sequencing reads, assemblies may contain misassemblies or unresolved regions, which can compromise downstream analyses. Since repetitive regions often contain biologically important elements such as insertion sequences and plasmids, errors in these regions can result in misleading biological interpretations (Koren et al., 2013). 

Nonetheless, there are a few approaches that have been developed to address the challenges posed by repetitive regions. Earlier approaches to genome assembly relied on paired-end sequencing strategies to help bridge repetitive regions. While paired-end reads can improve assembly by linking distant genomic regions, these methods add complexity and are limited when repeats exceed fragment lengths (Koren et al., 2013). More recently, long-read sequencing technologies have enabled more complete bacterial genome assemblies. Platforms such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) generate reads long enough to span many repetitive regions, substantially improving assembly contiguity (Wick et al., 2025).

Due to the relatively small size and simple structure of bacterial genomes, long-read sequencing can frequently assemble complete chromosomes into a single contig per replicon (Wick et al., 2021). Several long-read assemblers have been developed for bacterial genomes, including Canu and Flye (Wick et al., 2021). However, long-read assembly is not without limitations, as different assemblers can produce varying results from the same dataset, including missing or duplicated plasmids, extra contigs, or incomplete circularization (Wick et al., 2025).

Flye and Canu represent two widely used long-read assemblers with distinct strengths and limitations. Flye constructs repeat graphs to resolve unbridged repeats and is generally faster and more accurate than Canu, making it well suited for bacterial genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore data (Kolmogorov et al., 2019). In contrast, Canu produces highly contiguous assemblies but is slower and less effective at resolving highly similar repeats. Although Flye performs well for many bacterial genomes, it may still struggle with highly similar repetitive regions and may require additional finishing or polishing steps to achieve optimal base-level accuracy (Kolmogorov et al., 2019).

Following assembly, comparison to a high quality reference genome showcases the genomic differences and quality of assembly. Within Flye based workflows, Minimap2 enables efficient alignment of assembled genomes to reference sequences and is optimized for long-read data. Aligning an assembled genome to a closely related reference allows for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, deletions, and structural variants. However, differences seen in reference based comparisons may be due to real genetic variation between the assembled strain and the reference genome, not assembly errors (Magoc et al., 2013).

In this study, Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads will be assembled into a consensus genome for _Salmonella enterica_ using Flye. The assembled genome will be aligned to a reference genome obtained from the NCBI database to identify genomic differences and evaluate assembly quality.
